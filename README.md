# betabytez-website--Collapsible-Sidebar-
ðŸš€ Internship Milestone Unlocked â€“ Task 1 Completed!

As part of my internship at Elevvo Pathways, I successfully built a Collapsible Sidebar Component using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:

Responsive sidebar layout with smooth open/close animation âœ¨

Placeholder for logo at the top

Navigation links with icons ðŸ§­

Sidebar toggle button for seamless user control

Fully responsive design across desktop & mobile ðŸ“±ðŸ’»

This task enhanced my understanding of component layout, animation, and toggle logic, while ensuring clean UI/UX practices.
